Accalia Chandler Jay	£1,200	The founding of a Critical Thinking Society at Cambridge University that will provide rationality discussion workshops to Cambridge students. If this work goes well, they are considering having Cambridge students run rationality workshops at other schools and creating an evidence base for teaching rationality skills in the classroom. 	Effective Altruism Community	Public outreach
Adam Shriver	£20,000	A systematic review of pain researchers’ and philosophers’ attempts to define and explain the unpleasantness of pain, resulting in a publication and a detailed empirical research plan for resolving central questions.	Effective Altruism Community	Academic research
Amanda Askell	£28,630	A comprehensive monograph on the ethics and risks of artificial intelligence, co-written with Hilary Greaves at the University of Oxford. She believes that this monograph could be the foundation of graduate-level courses on AI ethics for computer scientists, and that it would both popularize and provide a solid theoretical foundation for work on the topic.	Long-Term Future	Academic research
Beatrice Fuchs	£3,680	A template/model for doing a "quick and dirty" assessment of an organization's impact. She aims to help the long tail of organisations that are good or great but can’t show impact, like large NGOs (like AMF), either through lack of resources for studies or from running a program around which it is hard to design a study. 	Global Health and Development	Independent project
Ben Pace	£5,150	Work on in-person and/or online community infrastructure for the rationality and EA communities. This will primarily take the form of helping to develop the new version of the rationality forum LessWrong, with others projects, like Europeans workshops encouraging long-term collaboration between EAs, under consideration.	Effective Altruism Community	Public outreach
Brian Tse	£662	Research into EA messaging tactics and career options in China. He hopes to facilitate bringing others in China into the space, using the lessons learned by EA groups in other regions.	Effective Altruism Community	Independent research
David Denkenberger	£20,960	Writing two papers on alternative foods that could be scaled up in time to feed everyone in the case of a global catastrophe. This research is predicated on there being an ~80% chance this century of a 10% global food shortfall, and a ~10% chance of agricultural collapse.	Long-Term Future	Academic research
Duncan Sabien	£44,120	The development of a rationality, agency, and EA-values education program for promising 12-14 year olds, either in a three-week camp format or as a year-long curriculum to be tested in a private or charter school.

John Salvatier	£27,575	Research on the underlying models and methods he uses to resolve disagreements between individuals with large inferential gaps. He will develop lessons to transfer these to test students, and see what skills are transferred and what skills still lack.	Effective Altruism Community	Independent research
